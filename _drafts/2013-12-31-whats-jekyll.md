I don’t intend the exploration of typography for my site’s redesign to be an argument for or against sans-serif fonts vs serif fonts. I think they both serve their purposes. As the quote above indicates, it really doesn’t matter which font combination you use, as long as the reader is able to focus on the message you are trying to convey.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.
