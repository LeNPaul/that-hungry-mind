**Reading a book is an exercise of mindfulness.** In order to read effectively, you have to tune out the world around you and focus only on what you are reading. That is why many times when I read, I find that I forget about the world around me and am fully immersed in whatever I am reading. That makes me happy.

**Reading is a window into another personâ€™s mind.** Millions of people have lived before us all, and a good percentage of those people have written books. Many of these books contain valuable lessons, whether they be lessons in quantum mechanics, or lessons on how to be happy. Reading is a source of learning and education. I like to learn.

**Reading is a window into another world.** Although <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/556058-i-think-nature-s-imagination-is-so-much-greater-than-man-s">the universe already has a great imagination</a>, I always enjoy immersing myself in another world whenever I read. In many ways, this is related to the first point I made on how reading is an exercise of mindfulness. This also makes me happy.

<a href="https://hungryminds.quora.com/How-to-Make-Reading-a-Habit">Reading is a habit that I developed</a> from a very young age that has greatly shaped how I grew and developed, and continues to do so to this day. It has transformed my life in so many ways that I can not even begin to list them all here, except for the general points I made above.

In addition, there are many <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/can-reading-make-you-happier">health benefits of reading</a>.

For that reason, I believe reading is one habit that has transformed my world forever, and I believe it can do the same for many others as well.
