#### Hi there! I'm Paul

I am a recent university graduate in physics, and I love to learn. I spend my time reading, programming, and learning whatever comes across my way that interests me. You can see some of the things I'm working on over at <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://codepen.io/LeNPaul/">Codepen</a>, which I also talk about in <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/">Projects</a>. You can find me over at <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Paul-Le-2">Quora</a>, where I typically answer questions on physics, programming, personal development, and productivity. I also run a blog on self-improvement on Quora, <a href="https://hungryminds.quora.com/">Hungry Minds</a>.

I love to learn, and believe online learning is the future of education. You can see my progress on <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/LeNPaul/">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/LeNPaul">Duolingo</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/lenpaul">Free Code Camp</a>, and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/LeNPaul">Codecademy</a>. I also love reading, which I track using <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54220411-paul-le">Goodreads</a>.

I started this website as a way to give back to people, and help other people learn. Below, you can find an archive of all the posts that I have written:
