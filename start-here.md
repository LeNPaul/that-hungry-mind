## Hi there!

This is my personal website, where I write about things that interest me. The journal section is where I write about general things, and the projects section is where I write about the projects that I am working on, and hopefully helping people out in the process. The tutorials section is where all of my tutorials are.

For a chronological list of all of my posts, check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/archive.html">archive page</a>.

For a list of all of my posts organized by topics, check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tags.html">tags page</a>.
