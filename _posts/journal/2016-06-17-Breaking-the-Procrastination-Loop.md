Many of us have at one point experienced procrastination. It is that feeling where you know you have something more important to do, but decide to do something else instead.

One thing to realize is that when you are procrastinating, you are caught in in an endless loop of getting distracted by other less important tasks. You jump from one task to another, always avoiding the most important ones. It is a cycle that gets progressively worse the deeper you go.

**Fortunately, there is a way out.**

Once you find yourself procrastinating, you must somehow break out of the procrastination loop. This is the hardest part of getting yourself to stop procrastinating.

Often times, another barrier preventing us from starting an important task is the thought of all the work that is ahead of us. We dread the mountain of work ahead of us, and decide to put it off for later.

**Here is an algorithm that you can follow to break out of the procrastination loop:**

1. Get rid of all distractions. Save all the things that you were doing previously, and leave only the important tasks open.

2. Stand up and go for a quick 10 minute walk, preferably outside and around the block.

3. Find a quiet place and meditate for 5 minutes. <a href="https://hungryminds.quora.com/Learn-to-Meditate-in-10-Minutes">Learn to Meditate in 10 Minutes</a>.

4. Set a timer for 25 minutes, and start working on your most important tasks. After the 25 minutes is done, repeat the steps again.

What doing all of this does is break you out of the procrastination loop, forcing you to clear your mind so that you can focus.

Going for a walk forces you to immediately stop whatever it was that you were doing to procrastinate, bringing you out of the cycle of procrastination.

Meditation allows you to clear your mind, further bringing you farther away from the procrastination loop.

By splitting that work into smaller, manageable chunks, you will be less intimidated and more motivated to start the work.

This isnâ€™t something that you can fix overnight, but in my experience, by following the steps outlined above whenever I catch myself procrastinating, I am able to get better and better at staying on track, and not procrastinating.
