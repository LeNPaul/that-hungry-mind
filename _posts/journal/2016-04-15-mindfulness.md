It’s hard to say who has had the most productive academic career ever, because there are many ways of measuring academic productivity, many of which are subjective.

Would you say someone who has published the most papers is the most productive, or someone whose work has had the most impact on our understanding of the universe today? How about someone who had an impact a wide variety of fields, not just one? Or someone whose students went on to produce excellent research?

Obviously, academic productivity is a very subjective thing. That being said, you can still name a few individuals who in some way fit some of the criteria described above. I know only of mathematicians and physicists, so my answer is definitely going to be biased:

A name that usually comes up when you try to think of someone with a prolific academic career is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdős</a>.

He was a mathematician who published and co-authored in so many academic papers that a term was coined to describe how many degrees of separation exists between Paul Erdős and any other researcher, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdős number</a>. Most mathematicians have a number on average of just 5.

Paul Erdős was a wandering mathematician. Everything he owned fit into one suitcase, and he would travel between universities, academic conferences, and the homes of other mathematicians all over the world. He would show up at a doorstep, and say, “my brain is open”, staying long enough until they had collaborated on a few papers. He would then leave and find another colleague to collaborate with.

In his lifetime, he wrote around 1525 papers, and collaborated with over 500 other colleagues.
