There are many ways to use your smartphone effectively, and what works for you may depend on what your own goals are. Here are some of my methods that work the best personally for me.

Hopefully you'll find a few useful tips:

In terms of productivity, my smartphone has been quite invaluable:

1. I use <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> as a to-do list manager, which syncs with a web application. I use it to keep track of everything that I have to do, and use it as an organizational foundation. I plan my entire day on it.

2. I use <a href="https://evernote.com/?var=1">Evernote</a> as a second brain of some sorts, where I put all of my internet clippings, notes from things that I read, notes for anything you can think of, etc.

3. <a href="https://pomotodo.com/">Pomotodo</a> is a pomodoro app, just like any other. I like this one in particular because I can record what I did during a single pomodoro, which is very useful for tracking what I do throughout the day. It also keeps track of interesting stats that are fun to look over.

In terms of education, there is a lot of potential with my smartphone, but I do delegate certain things to different devices:

1. I do have an eReader app on my phone called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldiko.android&hl=en">Aldiko</a>, but I do most of my reading on my dedicated Kobo Aura eReader.
I have an audiobook app on my phone as well called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ak.alizandro.smartaudiobookplayer&hl=en">Smart AudioBook Player</a>, and am constantly listening to a book when I go for walks, or find I have a lot of spare time waiting in line.

2. <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> is an excellent app for saving online articles for later reading, but it has also helped with my productivity because I can just save an article on Pocket to read later, rather than trying to read everything at once (and when I'm not supposed to be).

3. <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> has an excellent mobile app, but I usually prefer the web application. I'm currently learning French, and this has been a great tool (among other resources).

4. <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Youtube</a> has been a surprisingly good app for learning new things, granted, you use it productively, and watch high quality videos with educational content.
