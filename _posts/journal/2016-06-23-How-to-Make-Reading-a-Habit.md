In his book, <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/">*The Power of Habit*</a>, Charles Duhigg explores an idea that he calls the habit loop. This idea is central in understanding how our habits form, and provides insight on how to create our own habits.

## The Habit Loop

The breakdown of the habit loop is as follows:

**Cue:** This is any external or internal stimulus that causes us to want to do the habit. For example, walking by a bakery may cue us to buy a cake.

**Routine:** This is the actual habit that we do after we have experienced the cue. In the above example, it would be buying the cake and eating it.

**Reward:** This is the satisfaction or end result of the habit, what you get from following through with the cue to do the routine. I think it’s self-explanatory what the reward is in our example above.

**Duhigg argues that when we perform a habit, it is the cue and the reward that count the most.** You can substitute the routine with anything you want, as long as the cue and the reward remain the same.

In our cake example, maybe we wanted to buy the cake because we were hungry. Our real cue was hunger. So instead of using pure willpower to not eat the cake, we can carry around our favourite healthy snack to eat whenever we find ourselves craving something.

Another important idea that he talks about is that of keystone habits. These are habits which, when practiced, indirectly influence other habits to form. A good example of a keystone habit is that of food journaling. Participants in an experiment who were asked to track the food they ate daily found that they ate more healthy afterwards. The act of tracking their food forced them to realize how unhealthy they were eating, and to unconsciously make changes in their eating habits.

Understanding the habit loop is very powerful tool in working towards building a habit. Using the habit loop, we can build the habit of reading.

## Using the Habit Loop to Read More

There are many advantages to reading more books. Through books, we are able to explore a wide variety of ideas and concepts, all in one package, as opposed to information scattered across numerous articles all over the internet.

It is clear that in this case, the reward of having a habit of reading is being able to read and finish more books.

Here is a strategy that uses the habit loop to build the habit of reading:

1. Track your reading progress daily (a keystone habit)

2. View your list of books you’ve read, want to read, and the progress of books you are currently reading daily (the cue)

3. Set aside time to read daily, such as during lunch or while you are commuting (the routine)

4. When you finish a book, add it to your list of books you’ve read (the reward)

The first thing you should do is make a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> account. This is where you will be tracking your reading.

After you make your account, list of all the books that you’ve ever read, and add them to your ‘read’ shelf. Next, make a list of all the books that you’ve been meaning to read, but never got around to, and add them to your ‘to read’ self. This will form the foundation for your keystone habit of tracking what you read.

The cue is looking at the list of books you’ve read, and your progress on the books that you are currently reading. Goodreads has an excellent feature that not only tracks the books that you’ve read in the past, but also the books that you are currently reading, and how much progress you have made in each of them:

Every time you track your progress on the home page, you will see the progress bars filling up. Doing this will motivate you to want to read more, in order to make more progress and add more books to your ‘read’ list.

Of course, doing all of this will be pointless if you don’t set a routine of reading daily. This is often the hardest part, but if you set up your cue properly, and are motivated enough to read, you will be on your way to make reading a habit.

Here is some advice that you can follow to help you maintain your reading habit:

1. <a href="https://hungryminds.quora.com/How-to-Read-a-Book-a-Week">Audiobooks still count as reading</a>, in my opinion. You can listen to audiobooks on 1.5–2 times speed without losing comprehension, and finish a book a week.

2. Fill whatever free time you have with reading. <a href="https://hungryminds.quora.com/Productive-Ways-to-Use-a-Smartphone">You can use your phone to your advantage</a>.

3. An important thing to know about starting habits is to <a href="https://hungryminds.quora.com/One-Step-at-a-Time">always start small</a>, and build your way up. Don’t try to read a dozen books at once, start with just one book.

4. Try reading shorter books first. You will get through the books faster, and see progress sooner. This will motivate you to read more as you see your progress.

5. Make sure you only read books that you actually want to read. Don’t pick a textbook because you have to read this for school, this won’t work for that.
