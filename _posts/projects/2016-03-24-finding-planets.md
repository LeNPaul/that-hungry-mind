The concept of periodic time series appears everywhere in science, from geology, biology, chemistry, psychology, to astrophysics. By measuring the property of something over time, a periodic nature may appear in the data. The periodic nature of these kinds of data can reveal insights into the nature of what is being measured. In most cases though, this periodic nature is difficult to observe visually or qualitatively, and so various techniques are used to analyze the data, such as periodograms and discrete Fourier Transforms.

In this analysis, two types of astronomic data are analyzed using periodograms: data from a variable star, and data from a star with planets orbiting around it.
